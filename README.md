# QuantumDynamics
This repository contains the code for the Quantum Dynamics project. The group members are:  
Liza de Wilde  
Bas van 't Hooft  
Jorrit Hortensius  

This repository contains two files with code:  

1. Quantum Dynamics_1D  
This file contains the code for solving the 1D time-dependent Schrodinger equation.  
Starting with a gaussian Wavepacket, we place a potential barrier just a little higher than the  
(highest) energy of the wavepacket and we see Quantum Tunneling!

2. Quantum Dynamics_2D  
This file contains the code for solving the 2D time-dependent Schrodinger equation.  
Starting with a gaussian Wavepacket in the x-direction, we place a potential barrier with two 
small holes in the trajectory. As a result we see large parts of the wave reflect, and an interference  
pattern on the other side of the barrier.

There are 4 videos:

1. 1D_Trotterization  
2. 1D_Crank_Nicolson   
These mp4 files show the amplitude of the wave function (squared) in both real space and momentum space  
for the 1D case of a Gaussian wavepacket reaching a potential barrier. 

3. 2D_SplitOperator  
4. 2D_CrankNicolson  
These mp4 files show the amplitude of the wave function (squared) in real space for the 2D case of a  
Gaussian wavepacket reaching a two-hole barrier.
